            Busey ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Thats an advanced modern oxymoron. It was good, I like it and I beleived it. Man you got a way with using words. Thats like a lariat that does a snake whip on your back legs, I mean on the back of your legs - not that you have 4 legs - and pulls you this way, and thats what that line did to me and I believed every minute of it. Until I looked at the quadrangle that it produced with the verbs used in the sentence.
