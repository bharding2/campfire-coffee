###Jan14 - Events (partnered with Ethan Brown)
* Ethan Brown driving: created form in data.html to submit a new kiosk
* Ben Harding driving from here on out: added an array to hold all kiosks
* Wrote an event handler and event listener for the new kiosk form
* Added new kiosk to data.html tables
* Converted both tables to handle kiosks from an array (omg)
* Changed the total lbs by location per hour to total customers by location per hour

###Jan15 - Cleanup

* Sweet animated buttons on index
* Internal nav links added
* Styling fixes
* Added ability to edit kiosks
